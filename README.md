# About the Project
The Python Contact Book is a beginner-friendly, command-line application that helps you manage personal or work contacts.
It demonstrates the use of Object Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, and methods, along with file handling to store data persistently.

# This project allows you to:
Add new contacts with name, phone number, and email
View all saved contacts in a neat format
Search for a specific contact by name
Update a contactâ€™s name, phone number, email, or all details
Delete contacts you no longer need

All contact information is saved in a text file, so even after you close the program, your data remains safe and can be reloaded the next time you run it.

Key Learning Goals:
Practicing Python basics (loops, conditionals, functions)
Understanding OOP (classes, methods, encapsulation)
Working with file input/output for persistent storage
